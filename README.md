SpreeProductsContainer
======================

Easily generate (multiple) resources than contain products.

Installation
------------

Add spree_products_container to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_products_container', github: 'freego/spree_products_container', branch: 'X-X-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_products_container:install
```

Usage
=====

Generate a new `Look` resource:

    $ rails generate spree_products_container:resource look


Example output:

    create  app/models/spree/look.rb
    create  app/controllers/spree/admin/looks_controller.rb
    create  app/overrides/spree/layouts/admin/add_spree_looks.html.erb.deface
    append  config/routes.rb
    create  config/locales/en_looks.yml
    create  config/locales/it_looks.yml

Then run the migration:

    $ rake db:migrate

To rollback:

    $ rake db:rollback
    $ rails destroy spree_products_container:resource look


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_products_container/factories'
```
